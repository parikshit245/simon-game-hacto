# Simon Game Challenge

Welcome to the **Simon Game Contest**! In this game, you’ll replicate a sequence of button presses generated by the system. Sounds easy, right? But there’s a twist—some parts of the code are missing, and it’s up to you to fix them!

## Challenge Overview

The goal of the challenge is to restore the game's functionality by completing some missing pieces in the code. **Careful attention to detail and game logic is crucial!**

### What’s the Twist?

- The `checkAnswer()` function has some missing logic that needs to be fixed.
- There's a missing piece that determines how the game responds when something goes wrong. It's up to you to decide what should happen if the user's input is not correct.
- The functions are not been called. Can you figure out how you will going to call it?

### Game Description

- The game randomly generates a sequence of colors, and your task is to click the buttons in the same order.
- With each level, the sequence grows longer. Can you keep up?
- The game has a scoring system, but to make it work, you'll need to ensure the logic flows properly.

### Your Task

- **Fix the missing logic** in the `checkAnswer()` function. Think about what happens when things don't go as expected...
- The game needs to restart when a mistake is made. **But how?** You’ll need to figure that out.
- There's a key function missing. **Can you spot it?**

### Hints

- Pay attention to how patterns are compared in the `checkAnswer()` function. What should happen if they don't match?
- Think about what needs to happen when the user makes a mistake. What would be the logical next step?
- Sometimes, a game needs to reset after things go wrong... maybe there's a function for that?

### How to Play

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Press any key to start the game.
4. Follow the pattern of color sequences and click the buttons in the correct order.

### Winning Conditions

- The winner will be the participant who successfully restores the game logic and makes it work flawlessly.
- Pay close attention to game resets, sequence generation, and pattern comparison.

May the best coder win!

## Game Mechanics

- **nextSequence()**: Handles the next color in the sequence.
- **checkAnswer()**: Compares the user’s input with the generated pattern. It's missing a few key parts...
- **playSound()**: Plays sound for each button press.
- **animatePress()**: Adds a press effect to each button when clicked.

## Ready to take on the challenge?

Fix the missing parts of the code, make the game work perfectly, and claim your title as the Simon Game Champion!
